# YouTube-Video-Distribution-Center
A public repo that will record and redirect to multiple versions of videos I create and upload on YouTube primarily to different platforms, to minimize danger in case of any accounts getting wrongly banned.

# RATIONALE
The reason why I am choosing to have an elaborate archive of my own videos is the fact that I have had a history of false copyright strikes and bogus Community Guideline strikes.

Though I do want people to know that I AM THE PROBLEM in this case. I am fully aware 100% of the ones that aren’t spurious do have legitimate reason and ARE MY FAULT, it’s just that I live in a mindset that is 10 years older than I am when I am posting videos in regard to the rules and what was allowed to be posted on YouTube and on the Internet as a whole during that time and earlier. Not a justification or excuse, it’s a reason. 

At one point I was on a TWO STRIKES standing with the Community Guidelines, on the verge of being nuked off of YouTube for what started out as an unfortunate line of videos that got taken down for reasons that are going to be shown in the screenshots. 

## FAKE AND GAY STRIKES


* Onision False Copyright Strike
* “Cyberbullying/Harassment” Community Guideline Strike on a Livestream Covering the EDP445 Situation at the time. At the time other people have gotten similar strikes to mines. 
* “Child Safety” CG Strike | Was Later Resolved.
* "Medical Misinformation" off of me playing an RFK Joe Rogan Clip deep in a livestream when the gay COVID-19 misinformation policy was a very prevelant force.
* "Violent criminal organizations policy" because the video was titled 'What is the GD Dream?' mistaking GD for Gangster Disciple when it was a Geometry Dash video.
